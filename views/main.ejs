The CEO and Co-founder of Meta, Mark Zuckerberg stated, “The next [internet] platform and medium will be even more immersive, an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it.” This statement proves that he believes that the internet is still in its infancy, as we become more connected we need to improve the technology to become more immersive, where reality is intertwined with technology. The metaverse will be that technology that interacts with everyone and augments their world, building a smarter more virtual future where distance is not a concern. In conclusion, the metaverse is a broad term for a virtual connected space, where people can work, play, and socialize.</p>
